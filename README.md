<p style="color:#2980B9";><b>The intent of this repository is to learn how to make Restful APIs with Python Flask.</b>

The general workflow of this repository is:
  1) Concepts will be tested out and stored under the "Concepts" Prefix
  2) APIs generated from guided content will be stored under the "APIs" Prefix
  3) Custom APIs will be stored under the "Experiments" Prefix</p>
